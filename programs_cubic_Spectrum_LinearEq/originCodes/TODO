Possible function that is needed:

    basisInnerProduct(fun): return the inner product (v_i,fun) for all base function v_i
    baseNumbering : to generate a global number for all base. Gives getNoByIxyz, fun2No, No2fun
    
arbitary basis functions, only require that the basis should have a direct product form: v_i(x,y,z)=A(x)B(y)C(z)
    
struct speedUp: to record information that can accelerate calculation
    speedUp.baseOrder: record the order of each base, can be used to cut loops when calc inner product
    speedUp.crossBand: the width that (phi_i,phi_k) may be non-zero
    speedUp.defaultFunOrder: the maximum order of functions that used as initial/boundary conditions, will be used to set the default number of gauss points when 
                             calculating integrals with qgauss.
